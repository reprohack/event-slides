# Tips for Reproducing & Reviewing

---

## ReproHack Objectives

1. **Practical Experience in Reproducibility**

3. **Feedback to Authors**

5. **Think more broadly about opportunities and challenges**

:::

::: {.column width="46%"}

### Additional Considerations

- #### Reproducibility is hard!
- #### Submitting authors are incredibly brave!

### Thank you Authors! :raised_hands: 

- #### Without them there would be no ReproHack.
- #### Show gratitude and appreciation for their efforts. :pray: 
- #### Constructive criticism only please!

## Selecting Papers {.smaller}


:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="46%"}

- **Information submitted by authors:**

  - Languages / tools used (tags)
  
  - Why you should attempt the paper.
  
- **No. attempts `r icons::fontawesome('recycle')`** No. times reproduction has been attempted

- **Mean Repro Score `r icons::fontawesome('check-circle')`** Mean reproducibility score (out of 10)

    - lower == harder!
    
- Register paper using template in hackpad:

    ```
    ### **Paper:** <Title of the paper reproduced>
    **Reviewers:** Reviewer 1, Reviewer 2 etc.
    ```

## **Access**

<br>

- How **easy** was it to **gain** access to the materials?

## **Installation**

<br>

- How **easy / automated** was **installation**?

- Did you have any problems?

- How did you solve them?

## **Data**

<br>

- Were **data clearly separated from code and other items**?

- Were **large data files deposited in a trustworthy data repository** and referred to using a **persistent identifier**?

- Were **data documented** ...somehow...


## **Documentation**

<br>

Was there **adequate documentation** describing:
- how to **install** necessary software including non-standard dependencies?

- how to **use** materials to reproduce the paper?

- how to **cite** the materials, ideally in a form that can be copy and pasted?


## **Analysis**

**Were you able to fully reproduce** the paper? 

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="46%"}

[:white_check_mark:]{.larger}

- **How automated** was the process of reproducing the paper?

- **How easy was it to link** analysis **code** to:
   - the **plots** it generates
   - **sections in the manuscript** in which it is described and results reported
   
:::

::: {.column width="46%" .smaller}

[:no_entry_sign:]{.larger}

 - Were there **missing dependencies?**
 
 - Was the **computational environment not adequately described** / captured?
 
 - Was there **bugs** in the code?
 
 - Did **code run but results (e.g. model outputs, tables, figures) differ** to those published? By **how much?**
