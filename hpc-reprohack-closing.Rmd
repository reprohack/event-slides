## ReproHack Objectives

1. **Reproduce a paper from associated code and data**

3. **Feedback experiences to Authors**

5. **Think more broadly about opportunities and challenges**

<br>

## [ReScience C](http://rescience.github.io/)

> **ReScience C** is an open-access peer-reviewed journal that targets computational research and encourages the **explicit replication** of already published research, promoting new and open-source implementations in order to ensure that the original research is reproducible.



### What is a **Replication:** 
- Repeating a published protocol
- Respecting its spirit and intentions
-  **Varying the technical details**, e.g. using different software, initial conditions, etc.

#### Change something that everyone believes shouldn’t matter, and see if the scientific conclusions are affected
