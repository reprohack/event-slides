## Welcome to the 1st ReproHack Hub Launch!

<!-- Put the link to this slide here so people can follow -->

### `r emo::ji("wave")` from the organising team

#### _David Quigley & Anna Krystalli_

### Event Page: [bit.ly/hpc-reprohack-hub](https://bit.ly/hpc-reprohack)

Contains all event information and links to materials

### `r icons::fontawesome("twitter")` #ReproHackHub @ReproHack


???

Welcome everyone on behalf of the whole ReproHack team!

So, not all of us could sadly be here today, but you have got myself, as well as Linda Nab, who'm you'll hear a bit more from shortly.

I hope you've signed into the hackpad which has a lot of information, as does our event page. Both links should be in the chat.

Which brings us to why we are all here today.

So yes, we will be ReproHacking, so **working with code and data to try and reproduce** submitted papers.

> # Reprohack:
> #### Sandbox Environment for Practicing Research Reproducibility

--

> one day events using participants' laptops


<br>

Traditional format **excludes the examination of the reproducibility of computationally intensive research!**

--

# Enter the 1st HPC ReproHack


 
???

But what's what really special about today's event is that, for the first time, we'll be using our purpose built ReproHack Hub.

Right from the start of the project, we'd get requests from people that wanted to run their own events and we had tried really hard to create templates and make the infrastructure we used reproducible. 

But it was still complicated, a lot of moving parts, held together with a lot duck tape. We always wanted a centralised hub that provided all the required infrastructure so that event organisers (including ourselves) but also authors submitting papers or participants submitting reviews, would find it easy to do what they needed to do and focus on the experience itself.

It took a lot longer than we hoped but we are really so excited to share with you what we've created.

# Thank you! 

## EPSRC for funding

## Sulis for Compute Power

#### _and **David Quigley** for securing the funding_



???

I want to take the opportunity upfront to thank the N8 CIR, 

they've been firm supporters from early on, sponsored a number of previous events and also provided funding for developer time that got the hub off the ground so we really couldn't have  gotten here without their support.

# House Keeping:


???

So some quick housekeeping

## ReproHack hackpad `r emo::ji("right_arrow")`   [hackmd.io](https://hackmd.io/s/features) notepad


```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="90%"}
knitr::include_graphics("assets/hackmd.png")
```


???

As I've mentioned, we're also using a hackpad, specifically a hackmd hackpad. So this pad understands markdown, which is the text shown on the left and it is rendered on the right. If you are not familiar with markdown, don't worry too much, just use it as a plain text editor or you can have a quick look at hack md documentation, there's a link at the top of the hackpad.

# Ice breaker:  Introductions

<!-- Use this section as an ice-breaker. Introduce yourself, then allow others to 
go around the room and introduce themselves too -->

???

Now we're going to do a quick round of intriductions, and I'll put you in smaller break out groups and there's three questions Id like you to answer.

I'll go first:
---

<!-- Add details about yourself the organiser here: -->

## Who am I?

> ### Dr Anna Krystalli (@annakrystalli)
> 
> - Research Software Engineer _University of Sheffield_
>
> - 2019 Fellow _Software Sustainability Institute_
>
> - Software Peer Review Editor _rOpenSci_ 
>
> - Core Team Member _ReproHack_

---

## Why am I here?

> I believe there's lots to learn about Reproducibility from working with other people's materials and engaging with real published research code and data.


???

- I feel very strongly that working with these resources is a really powerful working experience. But also that if we don't engage with the materials, we (the authors who have put all this effort in included) won't really know if they are actually reproducible and therefore fit for purpose.

## Who is my favorite animated character?

> Stitch!

???

I think he's cute and my friends think that's who I turn into after I've had a couple of strong ciders!

---

<!-- Open it up to participants -->
# Your turn

### in small groups (5 mins)

> - ### Who are you?

> - ### Why are you here?

> - ### Who is your favorite animated character?

???

OK, so it's your turn now, I'm going to put you into break out groups where you'll have 5 minutes to answer these 3 questions amongst yourself.

# Tips for Reproducing & Reviewing

---

## ReproHack Objectives

1. **Reproduce a paper from associated code and data**

3. **Feedback experiences to Authors**

5. **Think more broadly about opportunities and challenges**

<br>

### + **Explore Reproducibility of Computationally Intensive research**

> #### All papers to be reproduced on the **Sulis High Performance Computing Platform!**

### Additional Considerations

- #### Reproducibility is hard!
- #### Submitting authors are incredibly brave!

### Thank you Authors! `r emo::ji("raised_hands")` 

- #### Without them there would be no ReproHack.
- #### Show gratitude and appreciation for their efforts. `r emo::ji("pray")` 
- #### Constructive criticism only please!
