???

Welcome everyone on behalf of the organising team, myself and David!


I hope you've signed into the hackpad which has a lot of information, as does our event page. Both links should be in the chat.

If you want to tweet aout today you can tweet at the reprohack project and/or

Let me start with some context into what brings us all here today.

---

&gt; # Reprohack:
&gt; #### Sandbox Environment for Practicing Research Reproducibility

--

&gt; #### One day events using participants' laptops

--

&gt; #### Traditional format **excludes the examination of the reproducibility of computationally intensive research!**


--

&lt;br&gt;

# Enter the 1st High Performance Computing ReproHack!


 
???

General concept. Authors submit papers with associated code &amp; data and participants try and reproduce the work from submitted materials.

Precludes computationally intensive research. A question we were getting at almost every event so we were keen to address it. So when David got in touch with us about a bid he was preparing and suggesting exactly that we jumped at the opportunity to collaborate.

Which brings us to why we are here today! The 1st HPC reprohack!

This is a pilot and we hope to come up with a blueprint for how to run such events. So what's different:

- Access to HPC cluster!
- Longer format with opportunity to work in your own time
- Mentors

In te afternoon, remember to take a coffee break and also submit your reviews by the end of the day.

At 4pm, we'll rejoin to hear from Stephen Eglen on the Code Check project.

We'll close by sharing our final thoughts about the experience followed by some closing remarks.

# House Keeping:

- ### No fire alarms expected
- ### Water point
- ### Toilets
- ### Code of Conduct &lt;https://reprohack.org/code-of-conduct&gt;

So some quick housekeeping

## ReproHack hackpad ➡️   [hackmd.io](https://hackmd.io/s/features) notepad


&lt;img src="assets/hackmd.png" width="90%" /&gt;


???

As I've mentioned, we're also using a hackpad, specifically a hackmd hackpad. So this pad understands markdown, which is the text shown on the left and it is rendered on the right. If you are not familiar with markdown, don't worry too much, just use it as a plain text editor or you can have a quick look at hack md documentation, there's a link at the top of the hackpad.

# Ice breaker:  Introductions

&lt;!-- Use this section as an ice-breaker. Introduce yourself, then allow others to 
go around the room and introduce themselves too --&gt;

???

Now we're going to do a quick round of intriductions, and I'll put you in smaller break out groups and there's three questions Id like you to answer.

I'll go first:
---

&lt;!-- Add details about yourself the organiser here: --&gt;

## Who am I?

&gt; ### Dr Anna Krystalli (@annakrystalli)
&gt; 
&gt; - Research Software Engineer _University of Sheffield_
&gt;
&gt; - 2019 Fellow _Software Sustainability Institute_
&gt;
&gt; - Software Peer Review Editor _rOpenSci_ 
&gt;
&gt; - Core Team Member _ReproHack_

---

## Why am I here?

&gt; I believe there's lots to learn about Reproducibility from working with other people's materials and engaging with real published research code and data.


???

- I feel very strongly that working with these resources is a really powerful working experience. But also that if we don't engage with the materials, we (the authors who have put all this effort in included) won't really know if they are actually reproducible and therefore fit for purpose.
---

## Who is my favorite animated character?

&gt; Stitch!
&gt;
&gt; ![](https://media3.giphy.com/media/95MU6SEzeLnUc/giphy.gif?cid=790b76115d11033236595055776d483b&amp;rid=giphy.gif)

???

I think he's cute and my friends think that's who I turn into after I've had a couple of strong ciders!

---

&lt;!-- Open it up to participants --&gt;
# Your turn

### in small groups (5 mins)

&gt; - ### Who are you?

&gt; - ### Why are you here?

&gt; - ### Who is your favorite animated character?

???

OK, so it's your turn now, I'm going to put you into break out groups where you'll have 5 minutes to answer these 3 questions amongst yourself.

# Tips for Reproducing &amp; Reviewing

---

## ReproHack Objectives

1. **Reproduce a paper from associated code and data**

3. **Feedback experiences to Authors**

5. **Think more broadly about opportunities and challenges**

&lt;br&gt;


--

### + **Explore Reproducibility of Computationally Intensive research**

&gt; #### All papers to be reproduced on the **Sulis High Performance Computing Platform!**

### Additional Considerations

- #### Reproducibility is hard!
- #### Submitting authors are incredibly brave!

### Thank you Authors! 🙌 

- #### Without them there would be no ReproHack.
- #### Show gratitude and appreciation for their efforts. 🙏 
- #### Constructive criticism only please!

&lt;br&gt;

### If the analysis was not fully reproducible 🚫
 - Were there **missing dependencies?**
 
 - Was the **computational environment not adequately described** / captured?
 
 - Was there **bugs** in the code?
 
 - Did **code run but results (e.g. model outputs, tables, figures) differ** to those published? By **how much?**
